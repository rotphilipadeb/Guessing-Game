<h2>Explanation:</h2>
<p><b>Game Initialization:</b> The game starts with a welcome message and prompts the player to choose a difficulty level.</p>
<p><b>Difficulty Levels:</b> The player can choose between Easy (10 attempts), Medium (7 attempts), and Hard (4 attempts). Input validation ensures only valid choices are accepted.</p>
<p><b>Random Number Generation:</b> A random number between 1 and 100 is generated for the player to guess.</p>

<p><b>Attempts Check:</b> The game keeps track of the number of attempts and stops either when the player guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.</p>
<p><b>End of Game:</b> A message is displayed if the player runs out of attempts, revealing the correct number.</p>
